<h1># OhMyPatch - FlagYard: Web</h1>

In the beginning we will take a look at the challenge name
OhMy"Patch" so probably we will deal with Patch request method.


We used dirb at the beginning and turned out there was 4 files:

```bash
dirb http://xxxx.playat.flagyard.com/

flag
patch
users
register
```

there's a file called flag! lets see whats inside..
